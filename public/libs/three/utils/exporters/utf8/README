Slightly modified "mesh.h" so that compressor:

- compiles with latest MinGW on Windows 64-bit
  (had to replace %z size_t formatting option)

- dumps to stderr scaling and offset parameters


Also for convenience added pre-build executable for Windows.

Latest version of compressor can be downloaded at webgl-loader repository:

Usage: ./objcompress in.obj [out.utf8]

        If 'out' is specified, then attempt to write out a compressed,
        UTF-8 version to 'out.'

        If not, write a JSON version to STDOUT.


Building:

Since there are no external dependences outside of the C/C++ standard
libraries, you can pretty much build this however you please. I've
included a cheeky way to do this on POSIX-like systems by including a
build shell script at the top of the file itself. You can build by
making the .cc file executable, and running it on the command line.
