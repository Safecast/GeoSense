# airbrake

Node.js client for [airbrakeapp.com][], formerly known as [hoptoadapp.com][].

## Install

``` bash
npm install airbrake
```

## Basic usage

The common use case for this module is to catch all `'uncaughtException'`
events on the `process` object and send them to airbrake:

``` javascript
var airbrake = require('airbrake').createClient("your api key");
airbrake.handleExceptions();

throw new Error('I am an uncaught exception');
```

Please note that the above will re-throw the exception after it has been
successfully delivered to airbrake, caushing your process to exit with status 1.

If you want more control over the delivery of your errors, you can also
manually submit errors to airbrake.

``` javascript
var airbrake = require('airbrake').createClient("your api key");
var err = new Error('Something went terribly wrong');
airbrake.notify(err, function(err, url) {
  if (err) throw err;

  // Error has been delivered, url links to the error in airbrake
});
```

## Features

* Automatically add `process.env` as well as other information when sending notifications
* Detect and fix circular references in error context information
* Support for all features of the [2.1 notification API][2.1api]
* Support for [long-stack-traces][]
* Optional auto-handler for `uncaughtException` events
* Provides notification url linking to airbrake in `notify()` callback
* Timeout airbrake requests after 30 seconds, you never know

## Adding context to errors

The `notify()` method automatically adds the following context information to
each delivered error:

* **error.class:** (`err.type` string if set, or `'Error'`)
* **error.message:** (`err.message` string)
* **error.backtrace:** (`err.stack` as parsed by [stack-trace][])
* **request.url:** (`err.url`, see `airbrake.url`);
* **request.component:** (`err.component` string if set);
* **request.action:** (`err.action` string if set);
* **request.cgi-data:** (`process.env`, merged all other properties of `err`)
* **request.params:** (`err.params` object if set)
* **request.session:** (`err.session` object if set)
* **server-environment.project-root:** (`airbrake.projectRoot` string if set)
* **server-environment.environment-name:** (`airbrake.env` string)
* **server-environment.app-version:** (`airbrake.appVersion string if set)
* **server-environment.hostname:** (`airbrake.hostname` string if set)

You can add additional context information by modifying the error properties
listed above:

``` javascript
var airbrake = require('airbrake').createClient("your api key");
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  if (req.headers['X-Secret'] !== 'my secret') {
    var err = new Error('403 - Permission denied');
    req.writeHead(403);
    req.end(err.message);

    err.url = req.url;
    err.params = {ip: req.socket.remoteAddress};
    airbrake.notify(err);
  }
});
```

Unfortunately `uncaughtException` events cannot be traced back to particular
requests, so you should still try to handle errors where they occur.

## Removing context from errors

In some scenarios you might want to filter some context to never show up in
Airbrake. For example you might have a private key loaded in your environment
memory, or your user has some critical data in his session, and you want to
hide that.

This can be done by hooking into the `'vars'` event like so:

``` javascript
airbrake.on('vars', function(type, vars) {
  if (type === 'cgi-data') {
    delete vars.SECRET;
  }
});
```

## Tracking deployments

This client supports airbrake's [deployment tracking][]:

``` javascript
var airbrake = require('airbrake').createClient("your api key");
var deployment = {
  rev: '98103a8fa850d5eaf3666e419d8a0a93e535b1b2',
  repo: 'git@github.com:felixge/node-airbrake.git',
};

airbrake.trackDeployment(deployment, function(err, params) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  console.log('Tracked deployment of %s to %s', params.rev, params.env);
});
```

Check out the `airbrake.trackDeployment()` API docs below for a list of all
options.

## API

### Airbreak.createClient(apiKey, [env])

Returns a new Airbrake instance.

### airbrake.key = null

The API key to use.

### airbrake.env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'

The name of the server environment this is running in.

### airbrake.host = 'http://' + os.hostname()

The base url for errors. If `err.url` is not set, `airbrake.host` is used
instead. If `err.url` is a relative url starting with `'/'`, it is appended
to `airbrake.host`. If `err.url` is an absolute url, `airbrake.host` is ignored.

### airbrake.projectRoot = null

The root directory of this project.

### airbrake.appVersion = null

The version of this app. Set to a semantic version number, or leave unset.

### airbrake.protocol = 'http'

The protocol to use.

### airbrake.timeout = 30 * 1000

The timeout after which to give up trying to notify airbrake in ms.

### airbrake.handleExceptions()

Registers a `process.on('uncaughtException')` listener. When an uncaught
exception occurs, the error is send to airbrake, and then re-thrown to
kill the process.

### airbrake.notify(err, [cb])

Sends the given `err` to airbrake.

The callback parameter receives two arguments, `err, url`. `err` is set if
the delivery to airbrake failed.

If no `cb` is given, and the delivery fails, an `error` event is emitted. If
there is no listener for this event, node will kill the process as well. This
is done to avoid silent error delivery failure.

### airbrake.trackDeployment([params, [cb]])

Notifies airbrake about a deployment. `params` is an object with the following
options:

* `env:` The environment being deployed, defaults to `airbrake.env`.
* `user:` The user doing the deployment, defaults to `process.env.USER`.
* `repo:` The github url of this repository. Defaults to `''`.
* `rev:` The revision of this deployment. Defaults to `''`.

## Alternative modules

This module is meant as a replacement for [hoptoad-notifier][], which does not
support all features of the [2.1 API][2.1api].

## Contribute

Besides bug fixes, I'd be happy to accept patches for:

* Automatically parsing `repo` and `rev` from the local git repository when
  calling `airbrake.trackDeployment()`. This can be done via `exec()`, but must
  not be done when specifying `repo` / `rev` by hand, or if they are set to
  `false`.

If you have other feature ideas, please open an issue first, so we can discuss
it.
